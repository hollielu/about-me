    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently studying JavaScript full time with the intention of becoming employed as a full stack developer. I fell in love with programming when I realized you don't have to be a mathematical genus to learn how to code.

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>
      I'm originally from Hawaii. When I was a teenager I lived in Indonesia, Singapore, Australia, and the Seychelle islands. For the past two years I was living in Seattle. I plan to move to Chicago next!

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>&#9702; Why are you learning to code?</h2>
    <p>
      Technology excites me because of the current impact it's having on our lives and every industry. I want to be a part of that change by learning how to build web applications that offer solutions to real-world problems.
    </p>
    <h2>&#9702; What are your hobbies?</h2>
    <p>
      In my free time I love reading, writing, yoga, attempting to meditate, and watching documentaries. My idea of a perfect afternoon is drinking a coconut milk latte in a coffee shop while reading a good book.
    </p>
    <h2>&#9702; What's one amazing thing you've done?</h2>
    <p>
      I was in a circus when I was a teenager and performed on aerial fabric which was pretty amazing. I wish I was still that flexible.
